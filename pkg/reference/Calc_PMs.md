# Tabulate a standard set of performance metrics, for comparing CMPs

Runs a fixed panel of performance metrics eg \[MSEtool::PM_Yield()\],
\[MSEtool::PM_Safety()\], \[MSEtool::PM_Stability()\], and
\[MSEtool::PM_Status()\], and stacks their \`@Mean\` (\`Stock x MP\`)
slots into one tidy table, for quick side-by-side comparison of
candidate CMPs.

## Usage

``` r
Calc_PMs(MSE, BlimFrac = 0.4, StabilityThreshold = 0.2, silent = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- MSE:

  An \`mse\` object (or list of \`mse\` objects, combined via
  \[MSEtool::CombineMSE()\]).

- BlimFrac:

  Numeric. Fraction of \`SBMSY\` used as the safety limit, passed
  straight through as \`Lim\` (with \`Definition = 'SBiomass'\`).

- StabilityThreshold:

  Numeric. Passed to \[MSEtool::PM_Stability()\].

- silent:

  Logical. Suppress the \[MSEtool::CombineMSE()\] summary message when
  \`MSE\` is a \`list\`. Default \`TRUE\`.

- StabilityThreshold30:

  Numeric. A second, looser \[MSEtool::PM_Stability()\] check (reported
  as \`Stability30\`) alongside the Resolution-24-09-standard 20% one –
  e.g. useful when a CMP clears a 30% year-on-year change bound
  comfortably but not the stricter 20% one, distinguishing "somewhat
  stable" from "not stable at all". \`ATV\` (\[MSEtool::PM_AAVY()\],
  mean year-on-year yield variability, unthresholded) is also always
  included.

## Value

A tidy \`data.frame\` with columns \`PM\`, \`Window\`, \`PI\`,
\`Stock\`, \`MP\`, \`Mean\`. \`PI\` is the \`PM\`/\`Window\` pair
collapsed into the single code expected by
\`analysis/08-Create-Slick.R\`'s \`PM_Codes\` (see \[.PM_Code()\]).
