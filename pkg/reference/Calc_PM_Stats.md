# Per-simulation values for the standard PM panel

Same fixed panel of performance metrics as \[Calc_PMs()\]
(\`PM\`/\`Window\` combinations), but keeps every simulation's own value
instead of collapsing to \`@Mean\`. Intended for populating
\`Slick::Boxplot()\`/ \`Slick::Quilt()\`/\`Slick::Spider()\` \`Value\`
arrays, which need a \`Sim\` dimension so that averaging over a subset
of selected OMs (in the \`Slick\` \`App()\`) is a mean over the raw
per-sim values, not a mean of the per-OM means \[Calc_PMs()\] would
give.

For probability-scale PMs (\`Safety\`, \`Stability\`, \`Status\`) the
per-sim value is read from \`@Prob\` (already the 0/1 indicator that
\`@Mean\` averages – confirmed identical to \`@Mean\` when re-averaged).
For natural-scale PMs (\`Yield\`, \`Depletion_Min\`, \`SB_SBMSY\`,
\`F_FMSY\`), which leave \`@Prob\` all \`NA\`, the value is read from
\`@Stat\` instead (the same slot \[Calc_PMs()\] averages for these).

\`Safety\`, \`Stability\`, \`Status\`, and \`Depletion_Min\` are all
naturally on a 0-1 scale and safe to use directly in a \`Spider()\`
chart (which requires every PI on a 0-1 or 0-100 scale); \`Yield\`,
\`SB_SBMSY\`, and \`F_FMSY\` are not and should be left out of
\`Spider()\`.

## Usage

``` r
Calc_PM_Stats(MSE, BlimFrac = 0.4, StabilityThreshold = 0.2, silent = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- MSE:

  An \`mse\` object (or list of \`mse\` objects, combined via
  \[MSEtool::CombineMSE()\]).

- BlimFrac:

  Numeric. Fraction of \`SBMSY\` used as the safety limit, passed
  straight through as \`Lim\` (with \`Definition = 'SBiomass'\`).

- StabilityThreshold:

  Numeric. Passed to \[MSEtool::PM_Stability()\].

- silent:

  Logical. Suppress the \[MSEtool::CombineMSE()\] summary message when
  \`MSE\` is a \`list\`. Default \`TRUE\`.

## Value

A tidy \`data.frame\` with columns \`PM\`, \`Window\`, \`PI\`,
\`Stock\`, \`MP\`, \`Sim\`, \`Value\`. \`PI\` is the \`PM\`/\`Window\`
pair collapsed into the single code expected by
\`analysis/08-Create-Slick.R\`'s \`PM_Codes\` (see \[.PM_Code()\]).
